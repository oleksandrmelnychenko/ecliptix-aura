//! Shared, domain-neutral contracts for AURA safety modules.
//!
//! The crate owns module registration, bounded inputs and outputs, lexical rule
//! validation, monotonic action policy, and content-free temporal projections.
//! Domain-specific detectors remain in `aura-kids` and `aura-military`.
